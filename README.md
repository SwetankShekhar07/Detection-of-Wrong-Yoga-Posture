# Detection-of-Wrong-Yoga-Posture
Yoga is an ancient Indian method of maintaining physical and mental well-being through physical postures called asanas, voluntary controlled breathing exercises called pranayama, meditation, and relaxation methods. The number of yoga practitioners has increased dramatically since the pandemic, with many engaging in unsupervised practice. Through the use of deep learning-based techniques that can estimate the correct stance executed by a practitioner, this study was designed
to make the work of such practitioners easier. Four distinct deep-learning
architectures were used in the study to apply this strategy: MediaPipe, OpenPose, PoseNet, and EpipolarPose. The images from S-VYASA were used to train each of
these architectures independently. recognized as a university. Five popular yoga
poses were represented by the photographs in this database: warrior stance, half- moon pose, triangle pose, tree pose, and mountain pose.
